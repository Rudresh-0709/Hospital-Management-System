To modify your Node.js and Express code to collect the necessary data for generating the Sales Trends Over Time chart (with Transaction Date on the X-axis and Total Amount on the Y-axis), you need to modify the query and data processing logic to group the total amounts by a time period (e.g., day, week, or month). I'll guide you through modifying the code to calculate the total sales for each period, such as per day or per month.

Steps to Modify Your Code:
Modify the Query: To fetch the total sales grouped by transaction date, you need to adjust the SQL query to aggregate the sales (total_amount) by the transaction date (either by day, week, or month). For simplicity, let's group by day in this example.

Process the Results: After you fetch the data, you’ll need to process it so that you can send the total sales per day to the front-end.

Send Data to Front-End: You'll send the processed data to the front-end, where it can be used to plot the line or bar chart.

Modified Code:
// Route to get total amounts grouped by date (day)
app.get("/get-total-amounts", (req, res) => {
    // Query to group total sales by day
    const query = `
        SELECT DATE(transaction_date) AS date, SUM(total_amount) AS total_sales
        FROM consumer_transactions
        GROUP BY DATE(transaction_date)
        ORDER BY DATE(transaction_date)`;

    con.query(query, (err, results) => {
        if (err) {
            console.error("Error fetching total amounts:", err);
            return res.status(500).send("Error fetching data.");
        }

        // Process results to send an array of dates and total sales
        const totalAmountsByDate = results.map(row => ({
            date: row.date, // Transaction date
            total_sales: row.total_sales // Total sales on that date
        }));

        // Send the data as JSON
        res.json(totalAmountsByDate);
    });
});

// Admin route for the pharmacy page
app.get("/admin/pharmacy", (req, res) => {
    // Fetch products
    const productQuery = `SELECT * FROM products`;
    con.query(productQuery, (error, products) => {
        if (error) {
            console.log(error);
            return res.status(500).send("Error fetching products.");
        }

        // Fetch consumer transactions
        const consumerQuery = `SELECT * FROM consumer_transactions`;
        con.query(consumerQuery, (error, consumer) => {
            if (error) {
                console.log(error);
                return res.status(500).send("Error fetching consumer transactions.");
            }

            // Fetch supplier transactions
            const supplierQuery = `SELECT * FROM supplier_transactions`;
            con.query(supplierQuery, (error, supplier) => {
                if (error) {
                    console.log(error);
                    return res.status(500).send("Error fetching supplier transactions.");
                }

                // Get total sales grouped by date (total_sales per day)
                const totalAmountsQuery = `
                    SELECT DATE(transaction_date) AS date, SUM(total_amount) AS total_sales
                    FROM consumer_transactions
                    GROUP BY DATE(transaction_date)
                    ORDER BY DATE(transaction_date)`;
                con.query(totalAmountsQuery, (err, totalAmountsResults) => {
                    if (err) {
                        console.error("Error fetching total amounts:", err);
                        return res.status(500).send("Error fetching total amounts data.");
                    }

                    // Map results into an array to send to the front-end
                    const totalAmounts = totalAmountsResults.map(row => ({
                        date: row.date, // Transaction date
                        total_sales: row.total_sales // Total sales on that date
                    }));

                    // Render the page with all the required data
                    res.render("pharmacy", {
                        products: products,
                        consumer: consumer,
                        supplier: supplier,
                        totalAmounts: totalAmounts // Pass total sales data to the view
                    });
                });
            });
        });
    });
});
Key Changes:
SQL Query Modification:

The query now selects the transaction date and groups the results by date using DATE(transaction_date).
It then sums the total_amount for each date using SUM(total_amount).
The ORDER BY DATE(transaction_date) ensures that the data is returned in chronological order.
Processing Results:

After the data is fetched, we map the results to extract date and total_sales (sum of sales for that date).
The data is then sent to the front-end as a JSON response.
Front-End Rendering:

The data (totalAmounts) is passed to the pharmacy view to be used in rendering the sales trends chart.
Next Steps for Front-End:
On the front-end side (e.g., using EJS, Handlebars, or another templating engine), you can then use JavaScript to plot the data received from /get-total-amounts using libraries like Chart.js, D3.js, or similar.

Here’s a sample code for rendering a line chart with Chart.js:

<!-- In your EJS or HTML template -->
<canvas id="salesTrendsChart"></canvas>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
<script>
    // Assuming totalAmounts is passed to the view as JSON data
    const totalAmounts = <%= JSON.stringify(totalAmounts) %>;

    const labels = totalAmounts.map(item => item.date);  // Get the date labels
    const data = totalAmounts.map(item => item.total_sales);  // Get the total sales data

    // Create the chart
    const ctx = document.getElementById('salesTrendsChart').getContext('2d');
    const salesTrendsChart = new Chart(ctx, {
        type: 'line', // You can change to 'bar' for a bar chart
        data: {
            labels: labels,  // X-axis labels (dates)
            datasets: [{
                label: 'Total Sales',
                data: data,  // Y-axis data (total sales)
                borderColor: 'rgba(75, 192, 192, 1)',
                backgroundColor: 'rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.2)',
                fill: true
            }]
        },
        options: {
            responsive: true,
            plugins: {
                legend: {
                    position: 'top',
                },
                tooltip: {
                    callbacks: {
                        label: function(tooltipItem) {
                            return '$' + tooltipItem.raw.toFixed(2); // Format the tooltip to show currency
                        }
                    }
                }
            },
            scales: {
                x: {
                    title: {
                        display: true,
                        text: 'Date'
                    }
                },
                y: {
                    title: {
                        display: true,
                        text: 'Total Sales ($)'
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    });
</script>
Summary:
The backend query has been modified to fetch total sales (total_amount) grouped by transaction date.
The results are processed and sent to the front-end in JSON format.
On the front-end, Chart.js can be used to visualize this data in a line chart or bar chart, where the X-axis represents the transaction date, and the Y-axis represents the total sales for each date.
This setup will help you create a Sales Trends Over Time chart to analyze the fluctuation of your pharmacy's sales.

this was my code for the previous chart , you cant use ejs syntax in js script
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
You're absolutely correct! Since the code you shared is using JavaScript, you can't directly use EJS syntax (like <%= ... %>) in it. Instead, we can send the data from your server (Express) as JSON and then use that data in the frontend JavaScript. Here's how you can fix the code so that it works correctly without EJS syntax, and the data will be dynamically fetched via the /get-total-amounts API endpoint.

Key Changes:
The labels (x-axis) will now be dynamically generated based on the data you receive from the backend. In this case, the labels will be the transaction dates (grouped by day) from your query results.
The data (y-axis) will be the total sales amount for each date.
Make sure the Chart.js chart data is properly structured and passed to it.
Updated Code:
Backend Code: Ensure that your endpoint (/get-total-amounts) is sending data in a usable format (with date and total_sales).

Your existing /get-total-amounts endpoint should be fine as it already returns an array of objects like this:

[
    { "date": "2024-11-01", "total_sales": 2000 },
    { "date": "2024-11-02", "total_sales": 1500 },
    ...
]
Frontend Code: Now, we'll modify your JavaScript to dynamically use the data fetched from the server.

Updated Front-End Script:
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>

<!-- Chart Canvas -->
<canvas id="salespharmacy" width="400" height="200"></canvas>

<script>
    // Fetch the data from the server
    fetch('/get-total-amounts')
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(totalAmounts => {
            // Extract the dates and total sales from the response data
            const labels = totalAmounts.map(item => item.date);  // Extract dates for the X-axis
            const data = totalAmounts.map(item => item.total_sales);  // Extract sales totals for the Y-axis

            // Create the chart with the fetched data
            var ctx = document.getElementById('salespharmacy').getContext('2d');
            var chart = new Chart(ctx, {
                type: 'bar', // You can change this to 'line' for a line chart
                data: {
                    labels: labels, // Date labels on the X-axis
                    datasets: [{
                        label: 'Total Sales Amounts', // Chart title/label
                        data: data, // Total sales data
                        borderWidth: 1,
                        backgroundColor: 'rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.2)', // Light blue color for bars
                        borderColor: 'rgba(75, 192, 192, 1)', // Blue color for bar borders
                    }]
                },
                options: {
                    responsive: true,
                    scales: {
                        y: {
                            beginAtZero: true, // Ensures Y-axis starts at 0
                            title: {
                                display: true,
                                text: 'Total Sales ($)' // Y-axis label
                            }
                        },
                        x: {
                            title: {
                                display: true,
                                text: 'Date' // X-axis label
                            }
                        }
                    },
                    plugins: {
                        legend: {

                        },
                    }
                }
            });
        })
        .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching total amounts:', error));
</script>
Key Changes Explained:
Fetch Data: The fetch('/get-total-amounts') function grabs the data from your backend. This data is expected to be in the format where each object has a date and total_sales.

Data Mapping:

The labels array is created from the date field in each object from the fetched data. This will be used on the X-axis.
The data array is created from the total_sales field, and this will be used for the Y-axis values.
Chart.js Setup:

The chart type is set to 'bar' for a bar chart (you can change this to 'line' for a line chart if you prefer).
The labels (dates) are applied to the X-axis, and the data (sales) are applied to the Y-axis.
Customizations like backgroundColor and borderColor are applied to the chart bars for better visual appeal.
Error Handling: If there’s an error during the fetch (e.g., if the server is down or the data is incorrect), the catch block will log it to the console.

Backend Route (/get-total-amounts):
This remains the same as before, and it should send the data in the following structure:

[
    { "date": "2024-11-01", "total_sales": 2000 },
    { "date": "2024-11-02", "total_sales": 1500 },
    ...
]
Final Thoughts:
Chart Type: You can easily switch between bar and line chart types by changing the type in the Chart.js configuration.
Date Grouping: You might want to consider different levels of date grouping (e.g., grouping by week or month) depending on your data size and the chart's purpose. Currently, this is grouped by day.
Styling: Adjust colors and chart options as needed to match your site’s style.
This solution will dynamically render the total sales data for each day, helping you visualize the sales trends over time.

can you give me mock queries for the consumer_transactions table that i made in mysql of the contents i gave you earlier
ChatGPT said:

Certainly! Below are some mock SQL queries for the consumer_transactions table based on the structure you provided earlier. These queries are designed to retrieve or manipulate data based on the columns transaction_id, consumer_name, consumer_type, contact_number, email, address, product_id, quantity, total_amount, and transaction_date.

1. Insert Data into consumer_transactions Table:
-- Insert mock transaction data into the consumer_transactions table
INSERT INTO consumer_transactions (transaction_id, consumer_name, consumer_type, contact_number, email, address, product_id, quantity, total_amount, transaction_date)
VALUES
(1, 'John Doe', 'New', '123-456-7890', 'johndoe@example.com', '123 Main St, Cityville', 101, 2, 100.00, '2024-11-01'),
(2, 'Jane Smith', 'Existing', '987-654-3210', 'janesmith@example.com', '456 Oak Rd, Townsville', 102, 1, 50.00, '2024-11-01'),
(3, 'Alice Johnson', 'New', '555-123-4567', 'alicejohnson@example.com', '789 Pine Ln, Suburbia', 103, 5, 250.00, '2024-11-02'),
(4, 'Bob Brown', 'Existing', '444-777-8888', 'bobbrown@example.com', '321 Birch St, Villageville', 104, 3, 150.00, '2024-11-02'),
(5, 'Charlie Davis', 'New', '333-222-1111', 'charliedavis@example.com', '654 Cedar Ave, Metrocity', 105, 1, 200.00, '2024-11-03');
2. Select All Data from the consumer_transactions Table:
-- Select all data from the consumer_transactions table
SELECT * FROM consumer_transactions;
3. Select Total Sales for Each Day:
This query aggregates the total sales by day, which can be useful for your "Sales Trends Over Time" chart.

-- Select total sales for each day
SELECT DATE(transaction_date) AS date, SUM(total_amount) AS total_sales
FROM consumer_transactions
GROUP BY DATE(transaction_date)
ORDER BY DATE(transaction_date);
4. Select Total Sales by Consumer Type:
This query calculates total sales for each consumer type (e.g., 'New' or 'Existing').

-- Select total sales grouped by consumer type
SELECT consumer_type, SUM(total_amount) AS total_sales
FROM consumer_transactions
GROUP BY consumer_type
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
5. Select Products Purchased by Consumer:
This query finds out which products were purchased by consumers, grouping the results by product_id and showing the total quantity sold for each product.

-- Select products purchased and total quantities sold
SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity_sold
FROM consumer_transactions
GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY total_quantity_sold DESC;
6. Select Sales Data for a Specific Consumer:
This query retrieves all transactions for a particular consumer (e.g., "John Doe").

-- Select all transactions for a specific consumer by name
SELECT * FROM consumer_transactions
WHERE consumer_name = 'John Doe';
7. Select All Transactions for a Given Date Range:
This query selects all transactions between two specific dates.

-- Select transactions within a specific date range
SELECT * FROM consumer_transactions
WHERE transaction_date BETWEEN '2024-11-01' AND '2024-11-03';
8. Select the Most Expensive Transaction:
This query selects the transaction with the highest total amount.

-- Select the transaction with the highest total amount
SELECT * FROM consumer_transactions
ORDER BY total_amount DESC
LIMIT 1;
9. Count Transactions by Consumer Type:
This query counts how many transactions exist for each consumer_type ('New' or 'Existing').

-- Count transactions for each consumer type
SELECT consumer_type, COUNT(*) AS transaction_count
FROM consumer_transactions
GROUP BY consumer_type;
10. Select Transactions with Product Quantities Greater Than 3:
This query retrieves all transactions where the quantity of items purchased is greater than 3.

-- Select transactions where quantity is greater than 3
SELECT * FROM consumer_transactions
WHERE quantity > 3;
11. Select Average Sales per Transaction for Each Day:
This query calculates the average total sales amount per transaction for each day.

-- Select the average sales per transaction for each day
SELECT DATE(transaction_date) AS date, AVG(total_amount) AS average_sales
FROM consumer_transactions
GROUP BY DATE(transaction_date)
ORDER BY date;
12. Select Transactions in a Specific Price Range:
This query selects transactions where the total_amount is within a given price range (e.g., between $100 and $300).

-- Select transactions with total_amount between $100 and $300
SELECT * FROM consumer_transactions
WHERE total_amount BETWEEN 100 AND 300;
13. Select Total Sales for Each Product:
This query calculates the total sales for each product by multiplying the quantity sold by the price for each product. You may need to join with a products table to get the prices of products.

-- Assuming there's a products table with product prices
SELECT c.product_id, SUM(c.quantity * p.price) AS total_sales
FROM consumer_transactions c
JOIN products p ON c.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY c.product_id
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
14. Select Sales Breakdown by Day of the Week:
This query shows total sales for each day of the week.

-- Select total sales for each day of the week
SELECT DAYNAME(transaction_date) AS day_of_week, SUM(total_amount) AS total_sales
FROM consumer_transactions
GROUP BY day_of_week
ORDER BY FIELD(day_of_week, 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday');
15. Select Total Sales for a Specific Product:
This query calculates the total sales for a specific product (e.g., product_id = 101).

-- Select total sales for a specific product
SELECT SUM(total_amount) AS total_sales
FROM consumer_transactions
WHERE product_id = 101;
Explanation of Columns:
transaction_id: Unique ID for each transaction.
consumer_name: Name of the consumer (customer) making the purchase.
consumer_type: Type of consumer (e.g., 'New' or 'Existing').
contact_number: The contact phone number of the consumer.
email: The email address of the consumer.
address: The shipping or billing address of the consumer.
product_id: The ID of the product purchased.
quantity: The quantity of the product purchased in the transaction.
total_amount: The total cost of the transaction (quantity * unit price).
transaction_date: The date the transaction was completed.
These are basic mock queries to interact with your consumer_transactions table in MySQL. Depending on your needs, you can adjust the queries further (e.g., adding more conditions, ordering results, or joining other tables like products or customers).



You said:
dont insert transaction id as it automatically incremented
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Got it! If the transaction_id is set to auto-increment, you don't need to manually insert values for it. Here's the corrected version of the mock SQL insert queries without the transaction_id field:

1. Insert Data into consumer_transactions Table (without transaction_id):
-- Insert mock transaction data into the consumer_transactions table (auto-increment transaction_id)
INSERT INTO consumer_transactions (consumer_name, consumer_type, contact_number, email, address, product_id, quantity, total_amount, transaction_date)
VALUES
('John Doe', 'New', '123-456-7890', 'johndoe@example.com', '123 Main St, Cityville', 101, 2, 100.00, '2024-11-01'),
('Jane Smith', 'Existing', '987-654-3210', 'janesmith@example.com', '456 Oak Rd, Townsville', 102, 1, 50.00, '2024-11-01'),
('Alice Johnson', 'New', '555-123-4567', 'alicejohnson@example.com', '789 Pine Ln, Suburbia', 103, 5, 250.00, '2024-11-02'),
('Bob Brown', 'Existing', '444-777-8888', 'bobbrown@example.com', '321 Birch St, Villageville', 104, 3, 150.00, '2024-11-02'),
('Charlie Davis', 'New', '333-222-1111', 'charliedavis@example.com', '654 Cedar Ave, Metrocity', 105, 1, 200.00, '2024-11-03');
Explanation:
I've removed the transaction_id from the INSERT INTO statement, as it's set to auto-increment in your database schema.
The rest of the fields remain the same: consumer_name, consumer_type, contact_number, email, address, product_id, quantity, total_amount, and transaction_date.
Sample Select Queries (No Changes Needed):
You can use the same SELECT queries as previously mentioned, since they don't rely on the transaction_id being explicitly provided. The queries will work fine with auto-incremented values in the transaction_id field.

If you need any more specific modifications or further queries, feel free to ask!

Great! Now that you've provided the products table with product IDs and names, we can enhance the queries for better context when joining the consumer_transactions table with the products table. This can allow us to get product names instead of just the product_id, for example.

Let's take a look at the mock queries for interacting with both tables, where I will join consumer_transactions with the products table based on product_id.

1. Select All Transactions with Product Names (Join with Products Table)
This query retrieves all transactions along with product names by joining the consumer_transactions table with the products table based on the product_id.

-- Select all transactions with product names from both consumer_transactions and products tables
SELECT ct.transaction_id, ct.consumer_name, ct.consumer_type, ct.contact_number, ct.email, 
       ct.address, p.product_name, ct.quantity, ct.total_amount, ct.transaction_date
FROM consumer_transactions ct
JOIN products p ON ct.product_id = p.product_id;
2. Select Total Sales for Each Product with Product Names (Grouped by Product)
This query calculates the total sales for each product by joining the two tables. It shows the total quantity sold for each product and the total sales (quantity * price).

-- Select total sales for each product with product names
SELECT p.product_name, SUM(ct.quantity) AS total_quantity_sold, SUM(ct.total_amount) AS total_sales
FROM consumer_transactions ct
JOIN products p ON ct.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
3. Select Transactions for a Specific Product (e.g., "Paracetamol 500mg")
This query retrieves all transactions where a specific product (e.g., "Paracetamol 500mg") was purchased. You can change the product name as needed.

-- Select transactions for a specific product (e.g., "Paracetamol 500mg")
SELECT ct.transaction_id, ct.consumer_name, ct.consumer_type, ct.contact_number, ct.email, 
       ct.address, ct.quantity, ct.total_amount, ct.transaction_date
FROM consumer_transactions ct
JOIN products p ON ct.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE p.product_name = 'Paracetamol 500mg';
4. Select Total Sales by Consumer Type with Product Names
This query calculates the total sales per consumer type (e.g., 'New' vs 'Existing') and includes the product names.

-- Select total sales by consumer type with product names
SELECT ct.consumer_type, p.product_name, SUM(ct.total_amount) AS total_sales
FROM consumer_transactions ct

Got it! Below are the mock INSERT queries for the consumer_transactions table, using the product names provided in the products table as a reference for the product_id.

Since the product_id values are automatically assigned based on the product names (1 for "Paracetamol 500mg", 2 for "Cefixime 200mg", etc.), I'll use these product_ids to create the mock transactions.

1. Insert Mock Data into consumer_transactions Table:
-- Insert mock transaction data into the consumer_transactions table with product_id references
INSERT INTO consumer_transactions (consumer_name, consumer_type, contact_number, email, address, product_id, quantity, total_amount, transaction_date)
VALUES

Explanation:
Product References: The product_id corresponds to the product_id values from the products table you provided. For example:
1 → Paracetamol 500mg
2 → Cefixime 200mg
3 → Amoxicillin 250mg
And so on...
Transaction Data: Each INSERT includes the following fields:
consumer_name: The name of the consumer (customer).
consumer_type: Whether the customer is 'New' or 'Existing'.
contact_number: The phone number of the consumer.
email: The email address of the consumer.
address: The consumer's address.
product_id: The ID of the product purchased, using the IDs from the products table.
quantity: The number of units purchased.
total_amount: The total cost of the transaction. (Note: you can adjust the total amount as per the product prices or calculate based on quantity * unit price).
transaction_date: The date of the transaction.
Notes:
For simplicity, I kept the total_amount consistent with what might be expected based on the quantity (for example, 2 units of "Paracetamol 500mg" with a price of $50 per unit would result in a total of $100).
You can modify the total_amount values based on your actual pricing logic or unit prices.

Explanation:
Increased Quantities: The quantities for each product have been increased from the previous set of mock data. For example:
"Paracetamol 500mg" quantity has been increased from 2 to 5.
"Cefixime 200mg" quantity has been increased from 1 to 3.
"Amoxicillin 250mg" quantity has been increased from 5 to 8.
And so on for the other products.
Total Amount Calculation: Since I’m using mock data, I’ve adjusted the total_amount proportionally to match the increased quantity. You can change the values if necessary based on your actual pricing.
For example, if a product costs $50 per unit, then 5 units would result in a total of $250.
Similarly, for a $50 per unit cost, 3 units would result in a total of $150, and so on.
Notes:
If you are calculating the total amount based on the price of each product (e.g., each "Paracetamol 500mg" costs $50), you can change the total_amount value accordingly for each row.
Ensure that the product_id used in the INSERT queries matches the corresponding product in the products table.
Let me know if you'd like to increase the quantities further or need any other adjustments!

You said:
i am using date time for my transaction date so the labels on the bars show the time also ,how can i fix that?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To resolve the issue of datetime labels on the bars showing the exact time along with the date, which can clutter the chart, you can format the transaction_date to display only the date (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD) or, if necessary, show the date at a more aggregated level (like month or week) depending on the context of your analysis.

Here’s how you can handle this problem:

1. In the SQL Query:
You can use the DATE() function in MySQL to format the transaction_date to only include the date part, ignoring the time. This way, only the date (without the time) will be retrieved for your chart.

Updated SQL Query Example (Using MySQL):
-- Query to retrieve total_amount and group by date (excluding time)
SELECT 
    DATE(transaction_date) AS transaction_date, 
    SUM(total_amount) AS total_sales
FROM 
    consumer_transactions
GROUP BY 
    transaction_date
ORDER BY 
    transaction_date;
DATE(transaction_date) will return only the date part (e.g., 2024-11-01).
SUM(total_amount) aggregates the total sales amount for each specific date.
You can change the grouping (e.g., by week or month) by using MySQL’s YEAR(), MONTH(), WEEK(), etc., if you prefer a higher level of aggregation.
2. On the Frontend (JavaScript/Chart.js):
You can also format the labels in your frontend JavaScript code when rendering the chart. Here's how to do it with Chart.js.

Fetch the Data (Backend): Make sure your backend sends the date in the correct format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).

Format the Labels (Frontend): Once the data is fetched, format the labels in JavaScript to ensure they appear cleanly without showing time.

Here is how you can modify your JavaScript code to ensure the labels are correctly formatted:

Example of JavaScript Code with Chart.js:
// Fetch the data from the server
fetch('/get-total-amounts')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        // Extract dates and total_sales from the data
        const labels = data.map(item => item.transaction_date); // Assuming date is in YYYY-MM-DD format
        const totalSales = data.map(item => item.total_sales);

        // Format the date labels to show only the date (YYYY-MM-DD)
        const formattedLabels = labels.map(label => {
            // You can adjust the format here if necessary, e.g. display only the month or year
            const date = new Date(label);
            return date.toLocaleDateString(); // Defaults to MM/DD/YYYY, change as needed
        });

        // Create the chart with the formatted date labels
        var ctx = document.getElementById('salespharmacy').getContext('2d');
        var chart = new Chart(ctx, {
            type: 'bar',
            data: {
                labels: formattedLabels, // Use the formatted labels for the x-axis
                datasets: [{
                    label: 'Total Sales Amounts',
                    data: totalSales,  // Data from the server (total amounts)
                    borderWidth: 1
                }]
            },
            options: {
                scales: {
                    x: {
                        ticks: {
                            autoSkip: true,   // This option automatically skips ticks to avoid clutter
                            maxRotation: 0    // Optional: Prevents the labels from rotating
                        }
                    },
                    y: {
                        beginAtZero: true
                    }
                }
            }
        });
    })
    .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching total amounts:', error));
Key Points:
Date Formatting: The new Date(label).toLocaleDateString() method formats the date to MM/DD/YYYY. You can adjust it as needed to YYYY-MM-DD or another format.
Auto Skipping: The autoSkip: true option in the ticks section helps to skip over ticks when the labels are too long or too close together, reducing clutter.
Max Rotation: maxRotation: 0 ensures that labels don't rotate if there's limited space.
Additional Formatting Options:
If you prefer a different date format, you can use libraries like moment.js or date-fns for more advanced date formatting.
To display the date at a weekly or monthly level, you can modify your SQL query to group by week or month using functions like YEAR(transaction_date), MONTH(transaction_date).
This approach will ensure that your chart labels are clean and don't display unnecessary time details.

how can  change the color of the chart labels?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To change the color of the chart labels in Chart.js (both x-axis and y-axis labels), you can modify the options in your chart configuration. Here's how you can adjust the label colors in the x-axis and y-axis using Chart.js:

Steps to Change Label Colors in Chart.js
For X-Axis Labels: You can modify the scales.x.ticks.color property to change the color of the x-axis labels.

For Y-Axis Labels: Similarly, use the scales.y.ticks.color property to change the color of the y-axis labels.

For Dataset Labels: You can change the color of the dataset label (e.g., "Total Sales Amounts") by using the datasets options, specifically the label color.

Example of Changing Label Colors in Chart.js
Here’s how to modify your chart to change the label colors:

// Fetch the data from the server
fetch('/get-total-amounts')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        // Extract dates and total_sales from the data
        const labels = data.map(item => item.transaction_date); // Assuming date is in YYYY-MM-DD format
        const totalSales = data.map(item => item.total_sales);

        // Format the date labels to show only the date (YYYY-MM-DD)
        const formattedLabels = labels.map(label => {
            const date = new Date(label);
            return date.toLocaleDateString(); // Defaults to MM/DD/YYYY, change as needed
        });

        // Create the chart with formatted labels and customized label colors
        var ctx = document.getElementById('salespharmacy').getContext('2d');
        var chart = new Chart(ctx, {
            type: 'bar',
            data: {
                labels: formattedLabels, // Use the formatted labels for the x-axis
                datasets: [{
                    label: 'Total Sales Amounts',

                                weight: 'bold' // Optional: Change font weight
                            },
                            autoSkip: true, // Automatically skip ticks if they overlap
                            maxRotation: 0 // Keep labels horizontal
                        }

                    }
                }
            }
        });
    })
    .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching total amounts:', error));
Key Changes:
X-Axis Label Color:

Set scales.x.ticks.color to 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)' for blue color. You can change this to any valid CSS color value (like #FF5733 for orange or rgb(0, 128, 0) for green).
font.size and font.weight options allow you to change the font size and weight for better visual customization.
Y-Axis Label Color:

Set scales.y.ticks.color to 'rgba(153, 102, 255, 1)' for purple. You can choose a color that fits your design.
Dataset Label Color:

The legend.labels.color property changes the color of the labels in the chart's legend. In this example, I set it to 'rgba(255, 99, 132, 1)' for red.
Bar Colors:

You can also change the color of the bars using backgroundColor, borderColor, and hoverBackgroundColor in the datasets section.
Customizing Colors:
You can use any CSS color format like:
Named colors (e.g., red, blue, green)
Hex colors (e.g., #FF5733)
RGB (e.g., rgb(255, 99, 132))
RGBA (e.g., rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)), which includes transparency
HSL or HSLA (e.g., hsl(120, 100%, 50%))
This should give you full control over the colors of the axis labels, the dataset label, and the bars themselves.

Summary:
By adjusting the color properties in the ticks section of the axis options (x and y), you can change the label colors. If you'd like to further customize or add more styling, you can continue to tweak the font and color properties in the chart's configuration.
